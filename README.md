# Liri-Node-App

# Liri/Assigment Description 
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# What will the Liri-Node App do?

* LIRI will search Spotify for songs
* LIRI will search Bands in Town for concerts
* LIRI will search OMDB for movies.

# Instructions 
* Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to your computer.
* Send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs.
* Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
